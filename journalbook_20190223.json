Went home over lunch to let Osker out and get some lunch. He's all backed up from being sedated.. apparently it can cause constipation for up to 48 hours. Hoping to hear back about his xrays today. \n\nHe graduates from puppy class tonight at TCOTC. We're not sure if we're going to continue there with tweeners, especially with the surgery coming up. We weren't overly impressed with their class structure.\n\nWe took O to his last socialization class and it was packed. Guessing since they were closed due to weather yesterday. There were a lot of dogs there his size which was nice so he had a good time running around. He actually did really well staying while lying down during the question session too. We got his graduation certificate and proceeded to Taco Bell for our now-traditional Taco Thursday.
